Analysis of Fashion Trends through analyzing datasets of purchased clothing and clothing styles.

Project Scope

I will be utilizing public datasets of fashion sales in order to anaylze trends of different clothing types and brand types. 

Steps:
1. Download public clothing sales datasets
2. Clean and organize data
3. Begin exploratory analysis (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and cognitive analytics)
4. Focus on understanding the flow over trends over time, especially any repeating cycles given the length of time the dataset allows
5. Create an interface for users to interactively understand the data

Further Steps:
1. Work on utilizing machine learning to predict future trends
2. Work on utilizing LLMs to provide fashion advice based on data
